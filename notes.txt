This is a creative assignment, with no specific right or wrong answer. How will we grade it? Here's what we'll look for.

Metric List and Values
You can select metrics, it loads from the API. When selected, the values auto update

Charting behaves like you would expect
Good y axis scaling, has an info hover box with values. Looks nice.

Good Git/GitHub Practices
Don't file Upload with 1 commit. Do have good commit messages.

You use and run our getting started code
Some peope don't. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Coding Standards
Use AirBNB style with ES6/7/2015 features

Bonus Points
Use React Hooks
Shows you stay current.

Runs free of console warnings
If React is warning you of something, you should fix it.

Handling Errors
Reconnect websockets, toast an error if received.

Use Redux
Store your values in redux.

Use Prettier
We use prettier to auto format code and so should you :)

GraphQL Subscriptions
Spending the time to subscribe to updates, instead of polling is 100

TypeScript
Not all of our projects use typescript, but some do. If you love it, flaunt it.

Creativity
Design choices? Something super cool? A++
